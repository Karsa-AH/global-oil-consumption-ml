# Global Oil Consumption Analysis with Machine Learning

This project explores global oil consumption data using three classic machine learning algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, make future predictions, and understand trends across different countries and years.

## 📊 Algorithms Used

- **K-Means Clustering** – Group countries based on consumption patterns.
- **Linear Regression** – Predict future oil consumption values.
- **Decision Tree** – Classify and understand decision rules behind consumption patterns.


## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset includes oil consumption data by country and year. (Due to size, you may need to download it manually or upload a sample.)

> If the dataset is too large for GitHub, consider using Git LFS or add a link to download it manually.

## 📈 Sample Outputs

- K-Means: Cluster plots of countries based on usage.
- Regression: Trend lines for future consumption.
- Decision Tree: Feature-based classification tree.
